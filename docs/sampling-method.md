## Interoduction to sampling techniques

1. **Population:** In statistics, the collection of all elements of interest is called a population.

    >**Finte population** If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

    >**Infinte population** If a population has indefinite or uncountable number of units, then it is called infinite population.

2. **Sample:** A representative part of elements selected from this population is called a
sample.

3. **Target population and sampled population** Target population is the whole group of interest. **Sampled population** The subset of the target population that has at least some chance of being sampled. 

4. **Random sample** Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random sample. Not equal for all sample. It is free from selection bias.

## Sampling technique

Sampling technique is a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

**Sampling Unit:** Sampling unit can refer to any single person, animal, plant, product or ‘thing’ being researched. In the context of market research, a sampling unit is an individual person. 
Example: Household survey, 

Another example of a sampling unit could be if you were conducting online research with 50 households, one household would be a singular sampling unit.

**Unit of inquiry:** A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required. It may or may not be the same
as the sampling unit. We may select a sample of households and obtain information about
household members. Here households serve as sampling unit and the household members serve
as the unit of inquiry.

**Sampling frame:** Sampling frame is the complete and up-to-date list of sampling units from which the sample is drawn. example Sampling frame for household survey.

**Parameter, Statistics, Estimator and Estimate:** Population charactersitic is called parameter. Sample charactersitic is called statistics. when estimate an unknown parameter, then it is called estimator. A particular value of the esimator is called an estimate. For example, population mean $(\mu)$, population variance $(\sigma^{2})$, population standard deviation $(\sigma)$, population proportion $(p)$, etc. are parameters. Sample mean $(\bar{x})$, sample variance $(\s{2})$, sample standard deviation (s), sample proportion $(\hat{p})$, etc. are statistics as well as
estimators.

**Non probability sampling** Non probability sampling is a non random or without any random expriment or select sample by personal judgment is type of sampling is called Non probability sampling. 

**Convenience sampling** Unrestricted/ Researchers or field workers have the freedom to choose whomever they find, thus the name convenience. 

**Accidental sampling** A sample gathered haphazardly, for example, by interviewing the first 100 people you ran into on the street who were willing to talk to you.

**Purposive sampling** Conforms to certain criteria is called purposive
sampling.

**Judgment sampling** Judgment sampling or expert choice. 

**quota sampling** Quota sampling is defined as a non-probability sampling method in which researchers create a sample involving individuals that represent a population. Researchers choose these individuals according to specific traits or qualities. They decide and create quotas so that the market research samples can be useful in collecting data. These samples can be generalized to the entire population. The final subset will be decided only according to the interviewer’s or researcher’s knowledge of the population.

For example, a cigarette company wants to find out what age group prefers what brand of cigarettes in a particular city. They apply survey quota on the age groups of 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, and 51+. From this information, the researcher gauges the smoking trend among the population of the city.

>**Advantages of quota sampling** Saves time, Research convenience, Accurate representation of the population of interest, Saves money

>**Disadvantages of quota sampling** 
- The choice of subjects is left to field workers to make on a judgment basis and
thus it suffers from selection bias.
- Since the procedure for selecting the sample is ill-defined, there is no valid
method of estimating the standard error of a sample estimator.

**Snowball Sampling** Snowball sampling or chain-referral sampling is defined as a non-probability sampling technique. 

For example, if you are studying the level of customer satisfaction among the members of an elite country club, you will find it extremely difficult to collect primary data sources unless a member of the club agrees to have a direct conversation with you and provides the contact details of the other members of the club.

- Advantages of Snowball Sampling
    - It’s quicker to find samples
    - Cost effective
    - Sample hesitant subjects
- Disadvantages of Snowball Sampling
    - Sampling bias and margin of error
    - Lack of cooperation

**Probability sampling** 
Probability sampling is the scientific method of selecting samples according to some laws of chance. 

**Simple random sampling:**
    To collect sample form population to chance equal and independent is known simple random sampling.

**Simple random sampling without replacement** If a unit is selected and noted and not returned to the population and this procedure is repeated
till n distinct units are selected, then it gives rise to a simple random sample of n
units, which is called the simple random sampling without replacement.

**Simple random sampling with replacement** If a unit is selected and noted and then returned to the population before the next drawing is made and this procedure is repeated
n times, then it gives rise to a simple random sample of n units, which is called the simple random sampling with replacement. Occasionally, sampling with replacement is referred to as unrestricted sampling.
