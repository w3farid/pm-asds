## Interoduction to sampling techniques

1. **Population:** In statistics, the collection of all elements of interest is called a population.

    >**Finte population** If a population has definite number of units, then it is called finite population.

    >**Infinte population** If a population has indefinite or uncountable number of units, then it is called infinite population.

2. **Sample:** A representative part of elements selected from this population is called a
sample.

3. **Target population and sampled population** Target population is the whole group of interest. **Sampled population** The subset of the target population that has at least some chance of being sampled. 

4. **Random sample** Any sample selected by chance mechanism with known chance of selection is called a random sample. Not equal for all sample. It is free from selection bias.

## Sampling technique

Sampling technique is a scientific process of selecting a sample from a population.

**Sampling Unit:** Sampling unit can refer to any single person, animal, plant, product or ‘thing’ being researched. In the context of market research, a sampling unit is an individual person. 
Example: Household survey, 

Another example of a sampling unit could be if you were conducting online research with 50 households, one household would be a singular sampling unit.

**Unit of inquiry:** A unit of inquiry is the unit about which information is required. It may or may not be the same
as the sampling unit. We may select a sample of households and obtain information about
household members. Here households serve as sampling unit and the household members serve
as the unit of inquiry.

**Sampling frame:** Sampling frame is the complete and up-to-date list of sampling units from which the sample is drawn. example Sampling frame for household survey.

**Parameter, Statistics, Estimator and Estimate:** Population charactersitic is called parameter. Sample charactersitic is called statistics. when estimate an unknown parameter, then it is called estimator. A particular value of the esimator is called an estimate. For example, population mean When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
